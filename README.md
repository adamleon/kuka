# KUKA-bulbasaur
This repository is a copy of the master branch at the IPK Gitlab repository exluding commit history and other branches.
A protected commit of a large `default_warehouse_mongo_db` inside `kuka_agilus_moveit_config` prevents this repository with full history to be pushed directly.
The database should be deleted from the Gitlab repository, the commit history cleaned and the cleaned repository pushed to a new repository.
